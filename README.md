# Downloads Per Day Sortation Script for Modrinth

Simple proof of concept for a new sort method, this sort method should be better overall for mod dicovery compared to sorting by total downloads. I think the next step would be a "downloads in the last (time period)", you can read more about that [here]([url](https://github.com/modrinth/code/issues/2938)). 

Don't know what I'm supposed to do or how to manage a repo, maybe I should've gone through a tutorial.


Special Thanks to Copilot for making this.
